<h1>The Complete JavaScript Course 2022</h1>

<p>This is a top-notch, well executed JavaScript course on Udemy by <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann">Jonas Schmedtmann</a>. It is about 70 hours long course which teaches you JavaScript from an absolute beginner's perspective upto an expert level programmer.</p>

<p>In this repository, I will upload files from Jonas' JavaScript repository as I have done the same work, and in future I will create another repository on JavaScript to represent my work, and the reason I have shared everything on this README file so that everyone understands that this is kind of a bootcamp repository and not my personal work.</p>
